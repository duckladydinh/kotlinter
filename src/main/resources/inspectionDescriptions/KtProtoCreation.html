This will help you migrate your Java proto builders to Kotlin DSL newly introduced by Google. As of now, we support the
following forms

<ul>
    <li><code>Message.newBuilder().build()</code></li>
    <li><code>Message.newBuilder(anotherMessage).build()</code></li>
    <li><code>anotherMessage.toBuilder().build()</code></li>
</ul>

In addition, we will by default use the `this.` expression for setters, and we strongly recommend using it.
